Download the 12 Rules to Learn to Code eBook [Latest Edition]



Hey,

After teaching over 100,000,000+ students online and in-person at the App Brewery programming bootcamps, I've seen students go on to work at Silicon Valley companies, found their own tech startups and become incredible developers. And they all started where you are now.

Remember, the fact that you can think, the fact that you can read this, the fact that you can learn and understand - all of this give you the ability to improve and achieve your goals. It's important to appreciate that not everyone is as lucky as you!

Over the years, I've summarised 12 key tips that set the top students apart. I've summarised it in this one eBook. I hope it will also help you in your learning journey!

To your success!

Your instructor, Angela
